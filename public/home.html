    <h1>Welcome to Snoot Land!</h1>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <h3>The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines the word "snoot" as:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>snout, nose</li>
      <li>a grimace expressive of contempt</li>
      <li>a snooty person: snob</li>
      <li>(verb) to treat with disdain: to look down one's nose at</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In modern lexicography (the practice of compiling dictionaries), however,
      the term refers to a person who adheres rigidly to tradition and authority
      when it comes to language and the usage of words. These snoots, also known
      as prescriptivists, are at war with the descriptivists, the liberal
      linguists who assert that authority and tradition only serve to stifle
      creativity. It's a battle too convoluted to delineate here, but the point
      is that you are about to embark on a quest to Snoot Castle to defeat King
      Snoot in the only way possible: by out-snooting him. Snoots derive their
      life force from pointing out and correcting others' mistakes. Deprive them
      of that by answering their questions correctly, and you'll accede to King
      Snoot's throne!
